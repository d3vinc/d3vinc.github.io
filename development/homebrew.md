## Update or upgrade the packages

First update the formulae and Homebrew itself:

```
$ brew update --verbose
```

You can now find out what is outdated with:

```
$ brew outdated
```

Upgrade everything with:

```
$ brew upgrade
```

Or upgrade a specific formula with `brew upgrade <formula>`, e.g.:

```
$ brew upgrade yarn
```

## Upgrade Homebrew

```
$ brew -v
Homebrew 3.2.10
$ brew update
...
$ brew -v
Homebrew 3.4.7
```
