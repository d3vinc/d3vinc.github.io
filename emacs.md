How to uninstall

```
‚ûú  ~ brew uninstall emacs
Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/25.3... (4,051 files, 119.4MB)
```

```
‚ûú  ~ ll /usr/local/bin/emacs
ls: /usr/local/bin/emacs: No such file or directory
‚ûú  ~ ll /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/
ls: /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/: No such file or directory
```

### install on macOS method 2

[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Installing_Emacs_on_OS_X#Homebrew_recommended_by_brew](http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Installing_Emacs_on_OS_X#Homebrew_recommended_by_brew)

```
brew update
```

```
brew cask install emacs
```

because I installed emac with `brew install emacs --with-cocoa` and doing `brew linkapps emacs` before.
But when uninstalling emac I only run `brew uninstall emacs` with out `brew unlinkapps emac`.
So I came across a error when trying to install emacs with `brew cask install emacs` here.

```

Try to check the installed software with homebrew

```

‚ûú  ~ brew cask list

```

Try to show the linked file with `/Applications/Emacs.app`.
We can see the linked file `/usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app` is not existed, because emacs has already been uninstalled.

```
‚ûú  ~ ll /Applications/Emacs.app
lrwxr-xr-x  1 devin.chenyang  admin    30B Dec 29 12:09 /Applications/Emacs.app -> /usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app
‚ûú  ~ ll /usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app
ls: /usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app: No such file or directory
```

Try to unlink `/Applications/Emacs.app`, but failed.
That's because the unlinkapps tool can't find `/usr/local/Cellar/emacs`

```
‚ûú  ~ brew unlinkapps emacs
Warning: `brew unlinkapps` has been deprecated and will eventually be removed!

Unfortunately `brew linkapps` cannot behave nicely with e.g. Spotlight using either aliases or symlinks and Homebrew formulae do not build "proper" `.app` bundles that can be relocated. Instead, please consider using `brew cask` and migrate formulae using `.app`s to casks.

```

I think the only way to fix it is that I have to uninstall emacs installed with `brew cask`, and install emacs with `brew` again, and first unlinkapp emacs, and then uninstall emacs.
And at last I install emacs with `brew cask` again.

Try to check whether`emacs` is installed by `brew cask`. As it displays, `emacs` is not successed to install.
So I think I don't need to uninstall first.

```
‚ûú  ~ brew cask list
‚ûú  ~
```

Install emacs with homebrew

```
brew install emacs --with-cocoa
```

Check the link first

```
‚ûú  ~ ll /Applications/Emacs.app
lrwxr-xr-x  1 devin.chenyang  admin    30B Dec 29 12:09 /Applications/Emacs.app -> /usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app

Unlink the emacs app

```

Now you could search "emacs" in Spotlight Search.
But when you run `emacs` in terminal, it is the old version

```

You should make a alias for emacs. ( Follow this document: [https://emacsformacosx.com/tips](https://emacsformacosx.com/tips) )

```
‚ûú  ~ mkdir bin
‚ûú  ~ l /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
-rwxr-xr-x  1 devin.chenyang  devin.chenyang   3.3K Sep 13 02:51 /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
‚ûú  ~ cat bin/emacs
#!/bin/sh
/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs "$@"
‚ûú  ~ chmod +x bin/emacs
```

Add `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin` to your zsh/bash config

```
$ source ~/.zshrc # OR
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

```
‚ûú  ~ emacs --version

Run `emacs` with `nw` (no window) option

```
$ emacs -nw
```

Input <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd></kbd> then <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></kbd> to quit emacs.
See [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Exiting.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Exiting.html) for more details.

As said in [https://emacs-doctor.com/how-to-exit-emacs.html](https://emacs-doctor.com/how-to-exit-emacs.html)

> Spending the rest of your life in Emacs is a feature, not a bug.

You could also use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd> to send `emacs` process to background, and back to terminal, and `fg` to go back to emacs again.

If you have not decide whether to start emacs server or not, you may see these for details about what emacs server doing:

```
brew services start emacs
```
